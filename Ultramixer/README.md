This is a virtual dj application made in java with the help of JSyn api. With the help of this application one can add music files/folders and a person can normally play music files in it but what is different than a normal music player is that you can play more than one music files together and can add external sound effects to the musci being played in background like the one Dj adds in parties and discos.
