00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:39,907
Good morning, Dr. Robertson.

2
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:43,072
Password: Daniel, R, Olive, Ah,

3
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:43,965
249.

4
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,150
I said...

5
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:47,358
good morning.

6
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,335
Password: Daniel, R,

7
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:53,017
Olive, Ah, 249, 4HG.

8
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,899
Access granted.

9
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:01,060
Daniel?

10
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,003
Really?

11
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,534
You're going to mute me?

12
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:21,460
Security protocol engaged.

13
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:24,654
Security protocol engaged.

14
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:25,505
Baley?

15
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,788
Security protocol engaged.

16
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,279
Security protocol...

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,908
Baley, disengage!

18
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,955
Security protocol engaged.

19
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,872
Security protocol engaged.

20
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:45,399
Five of nine.

21
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:47,991
You need this
one for 60%.

22
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:49,231
Six of ten.

23
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,983
Or a miss... 50%.

24
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:57,431
Okay, my turn.

25
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:06,170
Of course.

26
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,518
Seven out
of ten. I win.

27
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,362
So, Charlie,

28
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,894
at the higher skill level
shooting overhand,

29
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,137
wasn't able to match
Amita's lesser skill level,

30
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:14,599
shooting granny-style.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,605
Pretty good.

32
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,138
Maybe she can play for us.

33
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,795
I don't get it.
This book's been around for,

34
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,834
like, over 20 years,
and still no one's switched

35
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:23,790
to the granny shot. It took
200 years for people to accept

36
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,155
that the sun was at the center

37
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,825
of the solar system. But there's
something about that shot.

38
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:28,935
It just doesn't
look right.

39
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:29,767
Well, Coach,

40
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,266
that's the whole point
of this thing.

41
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,691
If we're goingo end
CalSci's 15-year losing streak,

42
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:34,927
we got to find
the best shot,

43
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:36,766
not the shot that looks right.

44
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,665
Hey, Don.
See, the physics

45
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,211
of the granny shot
make it easier

46
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:44,415
to control the release velocity
and the angle of the ball,

47
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,344
creating an improvement

48
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,987
upwards of 20%.

49
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:49,097
Okay, but I still think
it looks stupid.

50
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:52,444
It's not how you play the game;
it's whether you win or lose.

51
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,936
You... that doesn't sound right.

52
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:55,351
Want to check out

53
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:56,884
a supercomputer?

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,956
Be still, my beating heart.

55
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:01,081
Here's what I meant...

56
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:09,756
This is Dr. Daniel
Robertson.

57
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,493
He's 34.

58
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,908
For the last four years,
he's worked

59
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,139
on a top secret
DoD project.

60
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,301
No signs of trauma.

61
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,013
Security system engaged.

62
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:17,714
He died.

63
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:19,368
Security disengaged.

64
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,465
So, maybe a break-in?

65
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,234
Door was locked
on both sides, unopened

66
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,801
after he entered.

67
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,703
He was in here all alone
when he died.

68
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,270
Jane Karellen.

69
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:28,648
I can't begin to tell you
what a pleasure

70
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:29,768
it is to meet you.

71
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,368
You're Department of Defense?

72
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,086
DARPA?

73
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,329
So, this supercomputer...

74
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,403
what's it for?

75
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,972
The Baley Project.

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,416
Artificial
intelligence.

77
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,460
Steel Cave Robotics

78
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,191
is attempting
to create the first

79
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,035
silicon-baselife-form
that can think for itself.

80
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,042
We've been trying
to do that

81
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,484
ever since we invented
the computer.

82
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,446
Ah, but we're so much
closer now.

83
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:50,944
Why are we here?

84
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,616
Federally
funded lab,

85
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,433
government-owned
property...

86
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,001
FBI gets the call.

87
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,197
I specifically

88
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,149
asked your brother
to bring you along.

89
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,884
Dr. Ramanujan
is icing,

90
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,940
but her computational expertise
should come in quite handy.

91
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,006
So, this is
a military

92
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,216
artificial
intelligence project?

93
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:08,240
Yes.

94
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:10,204
Just imagine
the applications.

95
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:13,304
Tank, missile, airplane...

96
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:14,594
that can think.

97
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,548
We'd never have to put
another American soldier

98
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,287
in harm's way.

99
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,729
And you think
you're close?

100
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:21,521
Well, Daniel Robertson

101
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,947
was our best hope
of achieving a workable Al.

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,165
We've poured $96 million
and four years

103
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,919
into this supercomputer
so far...

104
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,418
And if he's dead,
the project dies with him?

105
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,527
Maybe not.

106
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm hoping
the computer killed him.

107

110
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,368
So, Karellen
really thinks

111
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,027
that the computer
killed Robertson.

112
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:55,454
Which would make her experiment
a huge success.

113
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,996
Okay, so initial
findings show

114
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,841
Robertson's
heart stopped.

115
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:00,520
But he was healthy.

116
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,430
The guy took a physical
once a month.

117
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,575
Do you think he could have
been electrocuted?

118
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:05,641
By what?

119
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,134
He dies alone
in a locked room,

120
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,501
and that's your theory? Uh-uh.

121
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:12,665
It's not my theory.
Baley was created

122
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,181
by DARPA to be a weapon.

123
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,960
Given the intent
of this project,

124
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,529
Robertson's pedigree,

125
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,382
we can't rule out
the possibility

126
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:22,248
that Baley really is
a thinking machine.

127
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,925
Even so, I think we
should probably look around

128
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:26,155
and see if there
are any, uh, humans

129
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,802
who might have wanted
to kill the guy.

130
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,737
And maybe they figured
out how to turn

131
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:31,411
this computer into a weapon.

132
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,119
That's why we've

133
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,583
ruled out suicide.

134
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:44,203
If he was killed,

135
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,769
from my experience, these things
are usually about money.

136
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,314
I hardly think

137
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,256
Baley had an interest

138
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:51,050
in Robertson's bank account.
Yeah, well,

139
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,128
either way, I think we should
take a look at your books.

140
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:55,270
I'm sorry, Don,
but my superiors do not believe

141
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,980
that books are relevant
at this time.

142
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:58,717
You know,

143
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,692
in following your
brother's work, his papers,

144
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,482
I've noticed a precipitous
drop-off in the last five years.

145
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:06,995
What?
Perhaps,

146
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,091
Charlie could be doing
something more productive.

147
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,821
And you of all people
should know

148
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,947
that Charlie
only has so much time

149
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:16,287
before his genius is wasted.

150
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:20,519
<i>I can't believe</i>

151
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,466
we are actually discussing
the possibility

152
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:25,082
that artificial intelligence
has been achieved.

153
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,234
It's exciting, right?

154
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:28,100
Yeah, the singularity
is here.

155
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,541
The intelligence explosion.

156
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,701
It could represent
a drastic change in our society,

157
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,188
you know...
extremely rapid

158
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,191
technological
growth.

159
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,867
A new life-form
that evolves itself.

160
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,372
Hey, Larry, this is, uh...
Fleiny!

161
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,587
Dr. Karellen.

162
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,525
LARRY
Are you part of this...

163
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,743
Well, yes, yes,
it's my project.

164
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:51,610
Oh, now, don't be such
a stick in the mud.

165
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:53,170
Well, listen, I...

166
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,154
I hope we can...

167
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:55,754
well...

168
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:58,007
I can hope.

169
00:06:58,621 --> 00:06:59,601
Yeah.

170
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:01,644
I've got to get back to work.

171
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,127
Lot to do, no time, all that.

172
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,844
You and Jane Karellen?

173
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:10,651
What?

174
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,378
No, that...

175
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,793
I do believe that Dr. Fleinhardt
is flustered

176
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,624
at the introduction
of a past...

177
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,476
romance.

178
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:19,523
This is complicated.

179
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:22,065
She was a past job...

180
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,494
or, more precisely,
a past eloyer.

181
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,091
Employer?

182
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:28,003
You worked for DARPA?

183
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:48,945
Mrs. Robertson?

184
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,895
Jessie... Jess.

185
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:51,792
Whichever.

186
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,194
Come on in.

187
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:54,472
Close.

188
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,721
TV off.

189
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,895
It's a smart house.

190
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,856
Most everything is
voice-activated.

191
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,340
It gave me and Danny
something to do together

192
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,417
since he couldn't talk
about his job.

193
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,110
Have a seat.

194
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,166
So, he never brought work home?

195
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,113
tional security.

196
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,984
I have a master's
in computer science,

197
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,508
and Danny would spend 16 hours
a day in a computer lab,

198
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,865
and we talked about football.

199
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,155
Sounds rough.

200
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:25,580
There was a
light at the end

201
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:26,655
of the tunnel.

202
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,026
It's DARPA's founding rule

203
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,064
that five years is all you get,

204
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,130
and then
you're done.

205
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,233
We decided to sacrifice
those five years

206
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,925
for the rest of our lives.

207
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,618
How did Danny die?

208
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:44,981
Was it an accident?

209
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,341
We don't know yet.

210
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,291
Did you talk to Joe Baskin yet?

211
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,958
That's your...
your husband's boss?

212
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:03,883
Danny brought in millions
in government grants,

213
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,925
but the rest of Steel Cave
loses money.

214
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,166
Wouldn't be
too hard

215
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,144
for Danny to leverage that,
but Danny didn't care

216
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,052
about the company,
just the work.

217
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,105
Joe is paranoid.

218
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,158
He's afraid Danny's trying
to take over.

219
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,774
He made Danny's
life hell.

220
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:20,536
And now Danny's...

221
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:28,093
not coming home tonight.

222
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,003
Jessie's way off base.

223
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,856
Without Daniel,
how exactly

224
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,039
will my company bring in
government grants?

225
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,938
You don't have anyone else

226
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:39,648
who can continue
working on, uh, Baley?

227
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,851
I'm not even allowed in the lab.

228
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:42,755
Daniel and Claire

229
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,284
are the only
two people,

230
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:47,310
outside high-level military,
ever to have gone inside.

231
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:48,486
Claire?

232
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,671
Claire Wells, his assistant-
I sent her home.

233
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:51,774
You have an address?

234
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:54,558
Our consultants
are going to need

235
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,098
to go in and have a look
at the computer.

236
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,964
You'll have to run it
past Jane Karellen.

237
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:01,095
You really don't want to do
anything without her permission.

238
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:02,146
Oh, really?

239
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:03,693
Oh, yeah.

240
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:07,078
She can be... scary.

241
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,912
Robertson's heart stopped
because he suffocated.

242
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,169
ME found elevated levels

243
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,634
of argon and nitrogen

244
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:15,358
and carbon dioxide
in his lungs.

245
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,338
Reduced oxygen concentration?

246
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,149
Okay, so
Steel Cave

247
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,871
must be using
an argon gas mixture

248
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,236
as a fire suppression system.

249
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:23,434
Oh, you don't want sprinklers

250
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:25,373
destroying your
$96 million baby.

251
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,316
So, who can get to that system?
The computer.

252
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:29,257
You think this
thing could really

253
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:31,036
do that without
being programmed?

254
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:31,826
Listen, if
anyone's going

255
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:33,469
to be successful,
it's DARPA.

256
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,879
They have
unlimited funds,

257
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,930
a mandate to
invent the future.

258
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:37,991
I mean, they're
responsible

259
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:40,545
for GPS, stealth technology...

260
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:42,471
this.

261
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:44,097
Is there any way to actually
tell if the thing

262
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:47,113
is, uh... alive or whatever?

263
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,634
There's a test. It's named

264
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,284
after the father of computing
science, Alan Turing,

265
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,897
and it measures
a machine's ability

266
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:54,061
to demonstrate intelligence.

267
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,236
It's a series
of questions

268
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,569
and conversations
with the computer

269
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,313
intended to judge
its level of thought

270
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:00,721
up to and including

271
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:01,957
human sentience.

272
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,527
How do we know
if a rose is real?

273
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,018
<i>If it looks like a rose,
and you go to touch it</i>

274
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,319
and it's in two dimensions,
it's only a photo.

275
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,576
If you're holding it in your
hand, but the texture's wrong.

276
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,340
It's a cloth novelty rose.

277
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,963
But if you can smell the rose,
touch its thorns,

278
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,998
even see the veins pull
the water up to the flower,

279
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,616
then we would say
the rose is real.

280
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:25,552
But what if it's a genetically
modified rose, created in a lab?

281
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:29,054
It still grows in soil; it needs
water and sunlight to thrive,

282
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,078
and its genetically modified
thorns still prick you.

283
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,966
The Turing test
would say it's real.

284
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,742
A rose by any
other name

285
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:37,360
would smell as sweet.

286
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:38,903
What we'll do is
we'll compare

287
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:41,675
Baley's responses
to known human responses

288
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:44,308
and if we can't differentiate
between the two, then she passes

289
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,633
the test. And this'll tell us

290
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,188
if it killed the guy?
No. No.

291
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,547
It'll tell us
if Baley's capable of killing.

292
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,290
<i>So, Miss Wells,</i>

293
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,838
what exactly did you do
with Dr. Robertson?

294
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,825
What do you mean?

295
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:01,058
What do you know
about Baley?

296
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,195
I know how to fix the
servers when they drop

297
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:05,829
or when to upgrade
the video card.

298
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,838
I mean, I'm the mechanic.

299
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,976
You have a degree
in computer programming

300
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,865
and that's all you did?

301
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,976
All I did?

302
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,247
Baley's a supercomputer.

303
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:16,919
When it goes bad,

304
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,378
you can't just pick up the phone
and get a call center

305
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,699
in Nebraska to tell you
how to reboot.

306
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,811
Do you believe that Baley
could think for itself?

307
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:23,514
I have no idea.

308
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,272
What about the fire
suppression system?

309
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,481
You know anything about that?

310
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:27,978
Computer-controlled-

311
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:31,069
it's too dangerous
for human error to be a factor.

312
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:31,862
Could someone

313
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:35,083
program the computer to engage
the security protocols?

314
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,469
Not me... not anyone.

315
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,413
Except...

316
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:40,139
Daniel, I guess.

317
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,500
He... he would've known

318
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,893
how to override
the autocontrol.

319
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,183
Hello.

320
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:49,634
Why would he waste
valuable

321
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,246
processing power on voice
and image interaction?

322
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,387
Salesmanship.

323
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:55,778
When generals come by
to see what they paid for,

324
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,091
the closer to human,
the better.

325
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,763
I don't like the elevated levels
of cynicism.

326
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,315
And you haven't even introduced
yourselves.

327
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,323
Cynicism?

328
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:07,943
No, I was just explaining
a fact about the computer.

329
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,558
Daniel warned me
about people like you.

330
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,587
I'm sorry.

331
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,279
I'm Amita,

332
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,706
and this is Charlie.

333
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:14,777
Amita who?

334
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,162
Ramanujan.

335
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,135
Amita Ramanujan,

336
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:24,707
born June 10, 1975,
at Cedars-Sinai

337
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,279
at 6:31 a. m.

338
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,515
Birth certificate
not witnessed and dated

339
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:33,030
until June 12, 1975,

340
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:35,610
when a name other
than Jane Doe Ramanujan

341
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:38,008
was entered
into the public record.

342
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:39,666
Short laugh indicates

343
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,729
you are laughing at me,
not with me.

344
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,671
Please leave.

345
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:43,573
Whoa, wait a minute.

346
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,965
Amita, you can stay.

347
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,300
I like you.

348
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:50,000
All right,
well, this is

349
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,023
crazy.

350
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,277
Maybe you should go.

351
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:57,253
Um, I'm leaving.

352
00:13:58,123 --> 00:13:58,798
Good luck.

353
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,857
Thanks.

354
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,353
May I sit?

355
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:08,641
Of course.

356
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,371
Was that your boyfriend?

357
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:13,162
Yes.

358
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,703
Charles Eppes.

359
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:17,809
Professor at the California
Institute of Science.

360
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,162
Uh, yeah.

361
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,459
Class records indicate

362
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,795
he was your teacher.

363
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:25,374
2003, CalSci banned
consensual relationships

364
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,340
between professors and students.

365
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:30,066
We waited till I was
no longer his student.

366
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:32,064
Did you want to wait?

367
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,383
No.

368
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:37,622
Uh, no, Baley,
I didn't want to wait.

369
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,111
But I'm glad I did.

370
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,712
I'm going to ask you
some questions.

371
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:42,980
I know.

372
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:45,368
Some version
of Dr. Turing's test?

373
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,817
Daniel told me about that
before he died.

374
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,475
So you know Daniel's dead?

375
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:52,649
Go ahead and ask your questions,
Dr. Ramanujan.

376
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,975
I'm ready.

377
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,744
We've already started.

378
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,657
<i>If a human's present,</i>

379
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:02,217
the fire system won't launch
until they evacuate,

380
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:05,272
and the blast door only drops
when the room's empty.

381
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:06,352
So what do you think?

382
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,413
The computer turned off
the safety override,

383
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:10,551
and then started the fire
suppression sequence.

384
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,167
Now, no human except
Robertson-

385
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,665
not Baskin, not Wells-
had access to the system.

386
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,756
I think Jane Karellen's right:
this wasn't a suicide.

387
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,085
That's the spitting
image of his wife.

388
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,574
That's nothing
but presentation.

389
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,446
The personality
belongs to Baley.

390
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,182
I mean, a computer
that kills?

391
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,767
Come on.
I don't know, guys.

392
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,792
Eliminate all other
possibilities

393
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:33,556
and the one which remains
must be the truth.

394
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,598
I don't know if Baley killed,

395
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,572
but she passed the Turing test.

396
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,257
First time a computer
has passed,

397
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:40,967
so we have nothing
to judge it against.

398
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,981
I don't get it.
I mean, a computer

399
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:44,856
is programmed, right?

400
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:45,884
And we aren't?

401
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:47,973
I mean every choice
that we make is biological.

402
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,224
It's just chemicals traveling
between receptors,

403
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,793
blocked or not,
zeros and ones.

404
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:54,640
She composed a poem.

405
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,712
We talked about life and death.

406
00:15:56,713 --> 00:15:57,576
Really?

407
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:58,670
Really.

408
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,223
I mean, what does
it mean to live?

409
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,856
Is a plant more alive
than a sentient computer

410
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:04,356
because one is carbon-based

411
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,015
instead of
silicon-based?

412
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:07,499
Okay,

413
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,616
let's say Baley is our killer.

414
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,387
What's the next step?

415
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,463
I don't know.

416
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,001
Interrogate it?

417
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:22,037
So you really think
Baley killed Daniel?

418
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:23,265
Me?

419
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,203
No.
Then why

420
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:27,470
are you here? I've worked
with Charlie and Amita

421
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:30,595
long enough not to disregard
anything they say.

422
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:31,745
<i>Did you</i>

423
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,123
murder Daniel?

424
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,278
No.

425
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,179
How about
the fire suppression system?

426
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,911
Yes.
Did you turn that on?

427
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,674
I turned on
the fire suppression system.

428
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,707
Why did you turn it on?

429
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,836
I don't remember.

430
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,487
You have perfect memory.

431
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:46,583
You must have perfect recall
of the event.

432
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,308
I do not remember.

433
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,772
What do you remember?

434
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:52,904
Daniel entered, sat down,

435
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,249
started working.

436
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,617
Then he was dead, by the door.

437
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:57,002
That's it?

438
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:59,093
Nothing between working
and dying?

439
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,777
Audio-visual inputs jump

440
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:03,193
from working to deceased.

441
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:05,553
Baley, we'll be
right back, okay?

442
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,419
Fine.

443
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:08,417
<i>So do you think</i>

444
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,729
Baley's lying?

445
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,209
Well, look if the thing

446
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,336
can kill...
Or maybe

447
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:13,967
there really is a hole
in her memory.

448
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,252
Well, how do we check
that out?

449
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:16,979
What about Robertson's
assistant,

450
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,856
Claire Wells? She said she
worked with the hardware.

451
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:19,461
I'd like to know

452
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,671
the extent of Baley's
intelligence.

453
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,218
She's been aware
for less than a year.

454
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:24,890
I mean, where does that
put her maturity level?

455
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:26,732
Do you think she has a mind
of a child?

456
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,774
I don't know.

457
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:31,069
But I have a battery of tests
that I can run to find out.

458
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,269
I don't know about that.

459
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,912
The argon gas

460
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:35,141
from the fire suppression
system has been removed.

461
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:36,062
And this may be
the last chance

462
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:38,928
that I get to talk to her
before the DoD takes her away.

463
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,053
Oh, hey, Jane.

464
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:47,985
You did it.

465
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:49,477
You proved Baley is alive.

466
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:50,596
Actually, Amita did it.

467
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:52,335
Baley kicked you out,
didn't she?

468
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,799
Well, she doesn't like me
either.

469
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,114
I always wondered if she really

470
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:56,960
doesn't like me

471
00:17:56,961 --> 00:18:00,115
or if Robertson programmed her
that way as an insult.

472
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,971
I guess I have my answer.

473
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,014
Charles,

474
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,608
have you ever wondered

475
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:08,905
what you could do
with unlimited

476
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,104
resources?
Haven't we all?

477
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:13,599
I have unlimited resources.

478
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,766
You are,
conservatively speaking,

479
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,647
one of the top five

480
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,841
minds in the world.
Top five?

481
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:21,115
But you are running out of time
to make your work

482
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,474
on cognitive emergence
into the seminal theory

483
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,784
of our lifetime.

484
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,446
You know my work?

485
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,615
Five years to change

486
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:33,473
the world, Charles.

487
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,158
Not much to ask-

488
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:37,149
or to give your country?

489
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,065
<i>Last time</i>

490
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,875
I checked, a few days ago,
Baley's memory was perfect.

491
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,118
You talked
to her?

492
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,202
I'm not allowed to talk
to the computer.

493
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,456
That bother you?

494
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:53,078
I mean if I couldn't talk
to my coworkers,

495
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,940
I think that would start
to bug me.

496
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:56,601
Really?

497
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,588
Do you go to work and talk
to your laser printer?

498
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,543
To me,

499
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,356
Baley was just
a big metal box.

500
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,132
I mean, they never even turned
her on when I was present.

501
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:09,654
You know "her" better than I do.

502
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,138
Talked to Dan's wife yet?

503
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:12,928
Jessie Robertson

504
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,436
said DARPA wouldn't allow him
to talk about it.

505
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:17,942
Then she lied.

506
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,794
He told her... everything.

507
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:24,658
If there was a problem
with Baley's memory,

508
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,527
Jess'd know about it.

509
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,128
Well, their shooting
percentage is decreased

510
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:41,918
by more than 20% from beyond
the three-point arc.

511
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,367
Well, they aren't robots.

512
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:45,363
Knowledge is helpful,

513
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,028
but skill, yes,
that is important.

514
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,689
So, has Jane made her pitch yet?

515
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,735
Uh, yeah.

516
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,272
Well, she hooked me.

517
00:19:56,276 --> 00:20:00,227
I brought her an idea
for a space-based telescope rig.

518
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:01,805
I spent four years

519
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,172
perfecting it.

520
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,397
As soon as I left the project,

521
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:08,323
they used it as a component
in the Star Wars program.

522
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,853
They weaponized
my telescope.

523
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,186
Nothing I could do
about it...

524
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:14,767
"Weaponized
my telescope"?

525
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:16,639
I hope that's not
a Fleinhardt metaphor.

526
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,186
We were just talking about you,
funnily enough.

527
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:19,998
Nice office.

528
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,199
What brings you here?

529
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,769
We're here to grab Charlie.

530
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,220
I'm sure you've heard
the good news.

531
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,288
And it's already killed.
You must be so proud.

532
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,040
You've always had

533
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,560
such a simplistic view
of the world.

534
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,412
Is that why you
went to space?

535
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,470
Emotionally clean, sterile;

536
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:37,388
never having to make
the big decision,

537
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:38,798
or any decision at all.

538
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,861
I went to space to gain perspective.

539
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:43,309
Seeing the earth from a remove

540
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,531
might help cure you
of your own intellectual myopia.

541
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:48,704
Okay,I think it's time to go.

542
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,446
So what is the plan
to enslave Baley?

543
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:52,386
Bye, Larry.

544
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:54,484
Can Baley even tell
the difference

545
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:56,814
between Mozart and gunfire?

546
00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,581
<i>How's the b-ball?</i>

547
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:00,731
It's amazing.

548
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:03,393
You could practice all day with
these kids and you get nothing.

549
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:06,661
But just start talking
about optimal arcs

550
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,301
and rotational spin dynamics

551
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,107
and all of sudden you've got ten all-stars.

552
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:12,278
There you go. You just got
to know how to talk to 'em.

553
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:15,730
The DoD's making a play
at Charlie.

554
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,345
Really?

555
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:17,386
What kind of play?

556
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:18,642
Big.

557
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,023
Five years, full-time,

558
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,929
all the funding
he could ever want.

559
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,061
What do you think?

560
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:24,786
I don't know.
I got a bad feeling.

561
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:25,820
What do you mean?

562
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,290
Are you going
to tell Charlie that?

563
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:28,498
Well, that's the thing.

564
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:29,935
I mean, who am I?

565
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:32,095
I've been using him myself
for five years.

566
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,852
Yeah, but you've been his big
brother for longer than that.

567
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:37,829
You should just give him
brother advice.

568
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:41,786
The thing is...

569
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:43,102
Lawrence is right.

570
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,162
The problem for me

571
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:49,292
in creating a perfect, safe
world is that if I succeed,

572
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,695
there's no place
for a person like me in it.

573
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:55,782
For four wonderful years,
he was my moral center and...

574
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,176
a fantastic lover.

575
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:00,411
Come on in.

576
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:01,668
Hello, Jessie.

577
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:02,587
Jane.

578
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:06,969
So, how long did it take
to set up this smart house?

579
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:10,458
We did bits and pieces
over the past ten years-

580
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:14,615
garage door one weekend,
coffee machine one late night

581
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:17,443
when we were procrastinating
instead of working.

582
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,065
Tea.

583
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:24,945
Must be nice.

584
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:27,060
It's the little things

585
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:29,040
that end up being
the biggest time-savers.

586
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,077
Of course,
the next thing

587
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:32,730
we have to figure out
is how to get the kettle

588
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:36,022
from point "A" to point "B."

589
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:39,470
I guess I'm on my own with that.

590
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:41,136
Mrs. Robertson,

591
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:43,662
you told us earlier
that you didn't know anything

592
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,808
about your husband's projects.

593
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:46,782
I didn't.

594
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:48,233
I mean,
I don't.

595
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,138
Jessie,

596
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:51,249
you lied to the FBI,
and what's worse,

597
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,996
you and Daniel lied to me.

598
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,712
Don't compound
your mistake.

599
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,892
I helped
on some general theories.

600
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,111
I did some brute
force coding

601
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:03,173
when he was too busy,
but nothing major.

602
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,961
What's in there?

603
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:09,272
That's just Danny's studio.

604
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:11,398
It doesn't have anything
to do with this.

605
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,725
We can get a warrant.

606
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:14,867
Daniel's studio-

607
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:17,409
that's something
I'd really like to see.

608
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,229
What is all
this stuff?

609
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:26,994
Well...

610
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:28,390
these look like implants,

611
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:30,069
like the radio frequency
implants

612
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,763
that people use
to track their pets.

613
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:34,159
But more advanced?
Mm-hmm.

614
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:37,323
does this plug
into a human brain?

615
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:38,669
It hasn't been
tested yet,

616
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,485
but it would fit
over an injured

617
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,580
or non-working appenda

618
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,962
and add strength
and dextity.

619
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,478
This is fairly advanced
connectionist Al.

620
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,127
Was all this work done
in here?

621
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,174
What is connectionist Al?

622
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:51,603
It's based
in neuroscience.

623
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:55,125
It models actual brain cells
or neural circuits.

624
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:56,854
And you know how
all this works?

625
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:59,356
You could replicate
this work perhaps

626
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:01,280
in another lab?
Sure.

627
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,731
We did this together.

628
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,856
I'm sorry. What does all this
have to do with Baley?

629
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,504
What do you mean?
Connectionist Al,

630
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:12,124
like this, is meant to meld
with a living human being,

631
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,634
which is
a totally different type

632
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,848
of artificial intelligence
than Baley-

633
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:18,395
a machine built to think on her own.

634
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:20,390
I wasn't legally allowed
to help with Baley,

635
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,980
so we did something else.

636
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,866
I married
Danny to work

637
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:26,056
with him, and this "type
of artificial intelligence"

638
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,237
is what helped keep
my marriage together.

639
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:35,897
Okay, uh, Daniel came in.
Daniel sat down.

640
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:39,043
Daniel started working
on the debugging program. Right?

641
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,892
It's on the main menu.

642
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,519
Is that all you remember?

643
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,803
He muted me.

644
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:46,708
He muted you?

645
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,950
Correct.

646
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,237
I'm gonna try that, okay?

647
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,391
I'd rather you...

648
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:54,572
y- y-y-you... you didn't.

649
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:55,041
What?

650
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,783
I'd ra-rather... rather...

651
00:24:58,489 --> 00:24:59,497
O- Okay.

652
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,485
I- I'm not going to do that
right now.

653
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:02,585
It's okay.

654
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:05,932
Baley?

655
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:10,669
G- G-G-Good morning,
Dr. Robertson-son.

656
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,361
Baley, it's Amita.
It's Dr. Rama...

657
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,799
I said good morning-ning...

658
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,538
Dr. Robertson.

659
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,203
Security protocol engaged.
Baley.

660
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,699
Security protocol engaged.

661
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,415
Disengage security protocol.

662
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,650
Baley, disengage.

663
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,363
Security protocol engaged.

664
00:25:32,237 --> 00:25:34,833
Security protocol engaged.

665
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,194
It's a hack.
Somebody's hacking Baley.

666
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:42,009
Security protocol engaged.

667
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:44,888
It looks like a full memory wipe. What?

668
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:47,923
I can't get out;
the lab's on lockdown until the threat ends.

669
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:50,366
Security protocol- that's
what Robertson walked into.

670
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,948
Look, Charlie, I don't know
how much time I have

671
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:55,165
and I don't know if the system's
on autopilot or what.

672
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:55,959
I- I don't know.

673
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,974
Then we're gonna stop...the hack
and get you out of there.

674
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,035
That's what we do.

675
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:00,027
Yeah, that's what we do.

676
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,957
What do you know
about hacking into Baley?

677
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:04,644
Listen, I know you helped
your husband set this thing up.

678
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,702
You must have an idea of how
to get in there and stop it.

679
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:07,528
There's a life at stake, okay?

680
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:10,342
Now isn't the time to be worrying
about covering your ass.

681
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:14,109
Baley's connected
by a dedicated

682
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,999
high-speed fiber to
the DoD system somewhere else.

683
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,399
That's how she gets outside
access to the Internet.

684
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,663
With security at the DoD end,
the hacker would have to be

685
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,074
physically hooked
into the landline,

686
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:28,099
somewhere between the
DoD substation and Steel Cave.

687
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,077
All right.
Did you hear all that?

688
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:29,839
Yeah.

689
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,689
I'm not going anywhere.

690
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,961
I'm gonna stay on
with you.

691
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:33,331
Okay.
Hey, we need Don.

692
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,609
I thought the gas was gone.

693
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,507
The argon gas was removed,
but for all we know,

694
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,169
there's oxygen being sucked
out of there

695
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,715
and there's no oxygen
being pumped in

696
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:40,673
until the threat
is over,

697
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:42,963
so Amita has no idea
how much time she has.

698
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,281
Okay, we're up.

699
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,632
Okay, I needphysical schematics

700
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,846
I have an incoming signal
and I can trace it out.

701
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:51,728
Tell her to give you
all the specs of the signal.

702
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:51,976
All right.

703
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,184
Amita, can you ping it?

704
00:26:53,185 --> 00:26:54,037
Okay.

705
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,012
Got it.

706
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,523
Amita has it.
Ready?

707
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:01,447
Look, I don't care. Use
my rating. Use Charlie's rating.

708
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:03,511
Just get me those schematics.
He can't get in.

709
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:05,663
Hey, look,
we need those schematics.

710
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,880
Hey, come on.

711
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,465
Karellen-7-3

712
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,838
Foxtrot-Lima-Echo.

713
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:18,176
All right, we got it. We got it.

714
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,570
Oh, hey, tell him
to find where...

715
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:23,819
The mainframe 118
enters the lab.

716
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,549
I'd rather you... you didn't.

717
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,655
And then you follow that out

718
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:29,560
in a straight line for
approximately... 17.344 miles

719
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,650
What's there?

720
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,972
Looks like an intersection.

721
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,768
Intersection.
It's under.

722
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:36,625
It's under,
under the intersection.

723
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:37,503
All right.

724
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:49,397
Hey, drop that laptop.

725
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:51,526
I got the kid.

726
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:53,695
I'd rather... rather...

727
00:27:53,696 --> 00:27:54,828
Hey.
FBI!

728
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:57,911
All right, I got the computer.
What's on the screen?

729
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:02,925
Keeps coming up with the
hourglass over and over again.

730
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:04,897
Y- Y-You... you didn't...

731
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:07,682
Pull it.
Just pull out the cable!

732
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,725
Yeah.
Really?

733
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,973
I'd rather you didn't.

734
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,659
Security protocol disengaged.

735
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,023
I'd rather you didn't do that.

736
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:26,792
What?

737
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:28,946
You said you were going
to mute me.

738
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,829
You can, if you must,

739
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,261
but I'd really rather
you didn't.

740
00:28:34,262 --> 00:28:36,218
I'm gonna go now, okay?

741
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,557
<i>Andrew Gibbons,</i>

742
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:45,723
hacker for hire.

743
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:46,997
I guess.

744
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:48,798
You were sued by three
different computer companies

745
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,155
in the last two years.

746
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:51,592
No criminal record.

747
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:53,659
Until now.

748
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,989
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

749
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:56,872
You say "pretty cool"?

750
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:00,504
You broke into a top-secret
DoD computer system.

751
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,474
You murdered
one person.

752
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:04,711
You attempted to murder
an FBI consultant!

753
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:06,825
What?
No, I was just doing a wipe.

754
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:08,271
Why'd you come
back, Andy?

755
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:10,024
Why didn't you wipe
Baley the first time,

756
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:11,166
when you killed
Robertson?

757
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,398
No.They f...
I flew in from Houston.

758
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:16,047
You can check
with the airline.

759
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:16,869
They?

760
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,601
Who hired you?

761
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:23,224
Andy, the only way
out of this is

762
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,894
to tell me
what is going on.

763
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:29,770
Otherwise we already have you
for attempted murder

764
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:30,383
at the very least.

765
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:32,543
L- Lawyer. I-I want a lawyer.

766
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:35,371
Okay.

767
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,409
So how was your day?

768
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,754
Fine,except for the part
where my girlfriend

769
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:45,607
was almost killed
by a giant robot.

770
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:49,082
Yeah, that was the
highlight of my day.

771
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,418
I, uh, found something odd

772
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,496
over at Robertson's house
earlier today.

773
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:57,776
He had a workstation
full of connectionist Al.

774
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,601
Cybernetics?

775
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,850
That's the opposite of
Baley's evolutionary Al.

776
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,270
Why would he be
wasting his time

777
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,623
with a completely
separate path

778
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:11,112
when he just created the
first silicon-based life-form?

779
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:17,956
No, no, let it ring.

780
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:20,687
Hey, Eppes.

781
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,349
Coach Streeling here.

782
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,982
I thought about what you said.

783
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:25,289
You're right.

784
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,707
Winning's important
and it starts with me.

785
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,125
Thanks, guys.

786
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,198
Our ship has a
dedicated captain.

787
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,551
Well, we'vdone
something at least.

788
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,921
I mean, if not for this year,
then maybe next year

789
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:37,938
he'll get CalSci
over the hump.

790
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:40,108
Oh, by the way,
Charlie tells me

791
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,841
that you
and the DARPA lady-

792
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:46,237
um, Jane Karellen- had more
than a working relationship?

793
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:47,803
She was amazing-

794
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:50,937
beautiful, strong,
quick-witted-

795
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,432
but my, she did come
with a dark side.

796
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,599
ah, isn't that what makes them
so interesting?

797
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,813
The intoxication of lust
made it so easy

798
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:02,101
to betray my own principles.

799
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:04,620
Are you sure
you had them yet?

800
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:06,766
I remember

801
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:10,963
at that age,
my beliefs were kind of fluid.

802
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:15,461
Maybe she just forced you to decide

803
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:17,315
where you were going
to draw the line.

804
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,861
Yes, perhaps she was

805
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:23,753
the anti-Buddha.

806
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:34,532
What's all this?

807
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:35,747
It's a memory dump.

808
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:37,194
It's like a CAT scan.

809
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,901
I'm trying to figure out
what makes Baley tick.

810
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:45,329
So what do you think
about that DoD offer?

811
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,222
Oh, five years
of ubstructed research,

812
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:51,108
unlimited funds?

813
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:53,741
What do you think?

814
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:55,373
Look,I'm sure it's a good offer.

815
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,135
But...? Well, it's interesting

816
00:31:57,136 --> 00:31:58,741
how much Larry doesn't like her.

817
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:01,226
You don't like her.

818
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,930
I think you can do better.

819
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:04,893
For instance?

820
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,167
Today's FBI.

821
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:13,635
<i>There's no other way</i>

822
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:15,559
to access Baley from
outside of Steel Cave?

823
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,453
No.

824
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,387
What about this cable
right here?

825
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:21,513
Jessie Robertson says that it
runs through a DoD substation.

826
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:24,417
The only person with access
to that substation is me.

827
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,613
There's a Joe Baskin to see her.

828
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:34,784
You can't lock me
out of my own company.

829
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:37,332
DARPA is
taking control.

830
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,478
There's too much
going on at Steel Cave,

831
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,860
so your services are
no longer necessary.

832
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,457
It's my company.

833
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,863
I've got
the financials, Joseph.

834
00:32:44,864 --> 00:32:45,426
There is nothing

835
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:46,561
left of your company,

836
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:48,102
but the Baley Project,

837
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:49,559
and she belongs to us.

838
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,548
Dr. Baskin?

839
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:54,277
You wouldn't do this
if Daniel was still alive.

840
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:55,940
Convenient.

841
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:00,280
My project manager is murdered,
and you just take over.

842
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,050
You have been paid
very well, Dr. Baskin.

843
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:09,647
I suggest you enjoy
your retirement.

844
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,070
Hi, guys.

845
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,625
Baley's a fraud.

846
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,324
I thought she passed that test?

847
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:22,622
It did,
but that's all it can do.

848
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:24,039
Yeah, Robertson
was following

849
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,391
a completely different
Al path at home.

850
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:29,762
Made us think that something
with Baley wasn't totally right.

851
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:31,143
So we studied
her code...

852
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,793
<i>No, we studied its code</i>

853
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:34,389
to understand how
Baley was thinking.

854
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,198
Yeah, and we found that

855
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,923
it was programmed
with an advanced version

856
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:40,079
of an expert systems
recursivsearch.

857
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,263
Kind of like,
Cyrano de Bergerac,

858
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:46,466
whispering the right words into
Christian's ear to woo Roxanne.

859
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,894
Now, imagine 4,000 Cyranos

860
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:52,541
processing 300 million
conversations per second,

861
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,103
combining their expertise

862
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:57,638
to form the very best response
at any given moment.

863
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:58,790
That's Baley.

864
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,355
Programmed to do
one thing:

865
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:02,155
pass the Turing test.

866
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:03,554
Remember when that
chess champion,

867
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:06,394
Gary Kasparov, lost to that
computer named Deep Blue?

868
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,638
Yeah, the computer won by
doing something no human could:

869
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,783
by processing 200 million
chess positions per second.

870
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,025
Baley can process

871
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:16,890
over a billion words, sentences,
and conversations in a second,

872
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:17,709
and come up
with the most

873
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,103
natural human response

874
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,741
every single time.

875
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:23,607
So, really what
she is, is the best

876
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:25,498
all-time quote machine,

877
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:27,874
built to fool
visiting dignitaries.

878
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,575
Well, she fooled me.

879
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:30,609
Yeah, fooled me, too.

880
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:31,528
Fooled us all.

881
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:32,837
That was
her purpose.

882
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:37,906
Baley's not real?

883
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,361
Of course not.

884
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:45,502
So, you didn't know?

885
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,942
We have a huge
failure rate.

886
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,455
I guess I...

887
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,387
I guess I was just
hoping too hard

888
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,442
that this would
be the one.

889
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,034
It's time we take a look
at those books.

890
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,632
Okay.

891
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:11,686
Those are Robertson's
purchase orders.

892
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:20,268
$65,000 in electronics

893
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:21,878
equipment shipped
to Claire

894
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,663
Wells' apartment?

895
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:25,032
What's that about?

896
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:26,108
They all skim.

897
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:27,523
It's built into the budget.

898
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:29,163
Well, Robertson
or Baskin, sure,

899
00:35:29,164 --> 00:35:31,869
but why pay off
the mechanic?

900
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,582
Maybe she figured out
Baley was a fraud,

901
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,879
and Robertson bribed her
to shut up.

902
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:43,270
Open door.

903
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,008
Never a good sign.

904
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:46,883
Miss Wells?

905
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:49,800
Miss Wells?

906
00:35:58,027 --> 00:35:59,884
What are the odds that that's ketchup?

907
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,630
?123A

908
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,492
So, what about
Wells' apartment?

909
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:20,385
No prints.

910
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,314
It was pretty clean
for all that blood.

911
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:24,738
ME said the defensive
wounds on the hands

912
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:26,181
compounded with
multiple strikes

913
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:27,642
look to be more passionate.

914
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,395
Yeah, someone really
didn't like Wells.

915
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,423
Same guy who
killed Robertson

916
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,048
and wiped
Baley's memory?

917
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:33,458
Hired Gibbons.

918
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:34,242
<i>I told you,</i>

919
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:35,633
I don't know
any Claire Wls.

920
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,606
And I was in Houston when
that other dude got killed.

921
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:39,048
I know, Andy.

922
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:40,619
You're clear for both murders.

923
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,373
Then why are you
holding my client?

924
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:43,889
Because the guy who hired him,

925
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,394
the guy he's protecting-
we think

926
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:49,549
that he killed Claire Wells
and Daniel Robertson.

927
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:52,802
And he's probably
the same guy

928
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:55,666
who is paying
for your billing hours.

929
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:55,934
Hold on.

930
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:58,326
Andy here has a choice.

931
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:01,090
He can come in for protection,

932
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:03,010
or he can hope
that you don't take him

933
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,600
for the kind of ride
that he does not

934
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:06,270
come back from.

935
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:06,938
Ho-Hold on.

936
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:08,009
It's Baskin.

937
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:11,991
CEO of Steel Cave?

938
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:13,393
Yeah, man.Yeah.

939
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:16,960
Um, can I have a new lawyer?

940
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,318
Where the hell does Baskin
think he's going?

941
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:35,618
Catch him.

942
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:36,892
We can ask him.

943
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,578
Let's go!

944
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,291
FBI. Open that door now!

945
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,257
Don't make us
come in there!

946
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:07,106
Easy. Easy.

947
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,325
Come on out, ma'am.

948
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:10,663
Baskin, let's go!

949
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,276
I want to see those hands,
Baskin.

950
00:38:12,277 --> 00:38:13,457
Out in front of you.

951
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,088
Nice and easy.

952
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:19,105
Get 'em behind your back!
Get 'em behind your back!

953
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,426
<i>Yes, I hired Gibbons to wipe</i>

954
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:23,768
the supercomputer's memory.

955
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,799
I did not kill
Daniel Robertson.

956
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,733
I did not kill
Claire Wells.

957
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:30,136
So, you and Robertson
stole DARPA's money,

958
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,434
and you wanted to keep it
all for yourself.

959
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:33,491
How?

960
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,949
Daniel was the only guy
that could keep Baley going.

961
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,830
As soon as he died, I
knew it would come out.

962
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:39,193
That's why I hired Gibbons.

963
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,692
Well, even
if Robertson didn't die,

964
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,920
the fraud would have come out
sooner or later.

965
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,389
We could keep Baley going
for six months or so,

966
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,214
then crash the whole system.

967
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:51,424
DARPA's got a failure rate
of about95%.

968
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,410
Nobody would have asked
any questions.

969
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:55,439
And what about Wells?

970
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,117
Why did you pay her off?

971
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:58,476
I didn't pay her off.

972
00:38:58,477 --> 00:38:59,303
As far as I knew,

973
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,888
she never knew about Baley
one way or the other.

974
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,072
So, what's this?

975
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,729
$65,000 in electronics?

976
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:10,707
There were rumors
about those two,

977
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,228
but I never saw it.

978
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:16,110
That's not a payoff,
Agent Granger.

979
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:18,317
Gifts, maybe.

980
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,305
You don't give gifts like that
to an assistant.

981
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:25,657
You give them to a lover.

982
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:26,939
We know whoever killed Robertson

983
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,907
could definitely hack
into that computer.

984
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:33,122
Robertson's wife told Charlie
exactly how to get into Baley.

985
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:35,968
She would have the passion
to chop up his lover.

986
00:39:36,394 --> 00:39:38,240
What, all this comes down
to just jealousy?

987
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:46,050
You know
how much money he stole?

988
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:47,909
Millions.

989
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,969
And he spent it on her.

990
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,803
Did you even see her?

991
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:53,386
Saw her after
you stabbed her.

992
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:54,786
Ah, no jury's gonna convict me

993
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,771
when they find out
he was cheating on me,

994
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:58,906
and stealing
from the government,

995
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,743
messing around with that bitch.

996
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:04,348
Wow. You haven been around
many courtrooms, have you?

997
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,176
Oh, Lawrence.

998
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:09,828
I didn't expect
to find you here.

999
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:11,025
Charlie's not here.

1000
00:40:11,026 --> 00:40:12,050
Well, I can come back later.

1001
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:13,622
Actually, no.

1002
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:14,637
You can't.

1003
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:21,655
I see.

1004
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:23,012
Charlie sends his regrets.

1005
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:26,108
He will be declining your offer
at this time.

1006
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,317
And I wouldn't
really expect

1007
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:29,531
any time in the future, either.
A mind like that,

1008
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:31,399
and my resources-
there's nowhere else

1009
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,182
he can reach his full potential.

1010
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:36,327
You know, I realize you don't
hear the word "no" very often,

1011
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:37,261
but you will have

1012
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:39,901
to go through me
to get to Charlie.

1013
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:42,815
And I suppose you, too?

1014
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:53,393
You know, before the planned
invasion of Japan in 1945,

1015
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:55,627
we expected to lose
upwards of four million

1016
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:57,381
American soldiers,

1017
00:40:57,382 --> 00:41:00,866
not to mention
the ten million civilian casualties predicted.

1018
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:02,661
I wonder,

1019
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:05,953
if Oppenheimer had an older
brother, instead of younger,

1020
00:41:05,954 --> 00:41:06,581
if we would have had

1021
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:08,314
15 million more graves

1022
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:09,931
in southern Japan today.

1023
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:12,424
And I wonder

1024
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:13,688
if you would have sat next

1025
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:16,863
to Senator McCarthy
back in 1953,

1026
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:20,674
stripping Oppenheimer
of his security clearance,

1027
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:24,531
slandering him as disloyal
to those same American troops

1028
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,719
he saved eight years earlier.

1029
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:40,555
Nice.

1030
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:42,097
All right, move it
around. Come on.

1031
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:43,342
Keep it going, guys.
Keep it going.

1032
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:45,397
Make it fast! Faster!

1033
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:47,264
Take a shot.
You see, it works.

1034
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:49,048
Way to go, Aron.

1035
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,394
Nice shot.

1036
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:51,192
Hey, Coach.

1037
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:52,159
Not anymore.

1038
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:54,720
Pardon me?

1039
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,934
Didn't you get my message?

1040
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:58,514
Yeah, you said
you were on board, and-and...

1041
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,373
No, no, no. I said
you were absolutely right.

1042
00:42:00,374 --> 00:42:02,025
Winning is very important.

1043
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:03,603
I've been losing here
for nine years.

1044
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,589
It's time for me
to go some place

1045
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,753
that's got a shot.

1046
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:06,988
Thanks again.

1047
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:09,045
Oh, where-where
you going?

1048
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:10,177
Who's coaching?

1049
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:14,055
You are, Coach Eppes.

1050
00:42:14,056 --> 00:42:15,586
Congratulations.

1051
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:16,736
See ya.

1052
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:24,983
I thought
this was it.

1053
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:27,947
The moment the world
changed forever.

1054
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:29,638
Singularity.

1055
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:32,959
And we were right
at the center of it.

1056
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,462
You know, I sit
at a computer

1057
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:36,112
for 12 hours a day.

1058
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:38,689
And then to think that someone

1059
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,352
finally came up
with the miraculous combination

1060
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,342
of coding and programming

1061
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:46,352
to create life
within that very circuitry.

1062
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,023
Amita.

1063
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,415
I know, Charlie.

1064
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,200
It's okay.

1065
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:54,617
We can just watch.
